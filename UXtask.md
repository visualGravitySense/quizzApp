# Fashion Industry Textile Waste Dashboard

I'll design a user interface for a dashboard that helps fashion brands analyze their textile waste data. This interface will focus on making the information accessible, actionable, and visually clear.

## Dashboard Design

### Header & Navigation
- Company logo and dashboard title "Textile Waste Analytics" at the top left
- Navigation tabs: Overview, Waste Categories, Facilities Comparison, Reduction Targets, Reports
- Time period selector (Last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, Custom range)
- User profile/settings in the top right

### Main Overview Panel
The primary dashboard would feature:

1. **Waste Summary Card**
   - Total waste metrics: volume (kg/tons) and cost impact ($)
   - Visual percentage change indicators (up/down from previous period)
   - Quick "Export" and "Share" buttons

2. **Waste by Category Visualization**
   - Donut/pie chart showing distribution of waste types:
     - Fabric scraps/offcuts
     - Rejected finished garments
     - Damaged materials
     - Thread/trim waste
     - End-of-roll remnants
   - Interactive elements to select categories for detailed view

3. **Waste Trend Graph**
   - Line chart showing waste volumes over time
   - Color-coded lines for different waste categories
   - Option to overlay production volume for context

4. **Facility Comparison**
   - Bar chart comparing waste across different manufacturing locations
   - Filterable by waste category
   - Sortable by volume or percentage of production

5. **Reduction Progress**
   - Visual gauge showing progress toward waste reduction targets
   - Comparative metrics against industry benchmarks

### Secondary Features
- **Actionable Insights Panel**: AI-generated recommendations for waste reduction
- **Financial Impact**: Estimated cost of waste and potential savings
- **Sustainability Score**: Overall rating with comparison to industry standards
- **Material Recovery**: Tracking of recycled/upcycled materials

Would you like me to expand on any specific part of this dashboard design, or would you prefer a more detailed visualization of certain components?
